## Scout-App Cultures & Translations

The source of truth for Scout-App translations is this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16FtHGThz0-CBz_rf_9QO4zOV7oNmNk2BlwmtvKuzAhs/edit?usp=sharing).

If you would like to translate Scout-App, edit that file and create an Issue on github informing us of the change.

By translating the app you get to pick what image is displayed for that language. It should be something culturally significant to native speakers.

## Memes

Scout-App wants to show a personal touch for each culture. So we attach some **culturally relavent image** with some Sass or CSS reference in it.

**Examples:**



### American English

King of the Hill is an American cartoon set in Texas following Hank Hill. He is known for saying "I sell propane and propane accessories".

### Russian

Vinni Pukh is a strange Russian adaptation of Winne the Pooh. He is a bit more existenstial, asking questions like "And why does honey exist? For me to eat it - I think so". So in this translation he is saying "Why does Sass exist? For me to use, of course!"

### Dutch

This is from a webcomic called "[Scandinavia and the World](http://satwcomic.com/the-whale-in-the-room)". It features Netherlands and Denmark. The translation reads "Do you think my sass file is too big? - That is literally a whale".

### Italian

This is the Leaning Tower of Pisa from Italy with some CSS being applied to cause it's famous slant.

### Spanish

An image of Don Quixote with the text "Too much CSS may be madness. And maddest of all, to see CSS as it is and not as it should be." Based on the quote "Too much sanity may be madness. And maddest of all, to see life as it is and not as it should be."
